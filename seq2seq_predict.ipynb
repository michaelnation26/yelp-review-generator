would. i bought tickets online and they only accepted cash. that\\'s not how they treat their customers. i didn\\'t know how a company handles a credit card. the owner said he was a \" manager \" and he couldn\\'t assist me. then he kept telling me \" they don\\'thing for your card or cash. \" i told him this was so bad that i couldn\\'nt believe. it was like being a number to him. it is ridiculous. i won\\'t be going back.',\n"," \"i'm giving it 2 starts simply based on the fact that the experience was just for me. i've never had more of an experience than that! after a series of laughs, i'll go forward with this review for a reason but i don't think anything stands out to me. first of all, this was my first time here since they moved, so i was pretty excited to see their new magic show there, so naturally we had to do something. then we were greeted by a very friendly person who showed us around. he let us stay, and the show started over an hour later. he told\",\n"," 'i\\'m not a fan of the food. i like to eat my food while i\\'re at the bar, but i was really in the mood for a movie. so, we went to my local barbeque event. first off, a lot of the people ( not a

center, just before the holiday, to see the famous harry potter theme and show. i had read the reviews for a popular harry potter fanie, but thought it would be great to have some sort of fun. we met our expectations ahead of time - we had heard great stories about harry potter, and i'd be so happy to be able to attend another event when we visited. the magic was great and the owner / chef, sam, was really nice!\",\n"," \"there's something about having a place like this open for the masses. you can walk down the street to the place and you know there're only a few people ahead of you. i was amazed when this magic bar opened and my friend went for a party with his cousin who was visiting for the weekend. and boy did we go. the people who work here are so friendly, funny and funny. i'd
